# Specification Document: Multi-Agent Log Processing and Anomaly Detection System

## Overview  
This document specifies a multi-agent architecture for automated extraction, timeline construction, and anomaly detection from large volumes of heterogeneous time series logs. It covers agent roles, dynamic log parsing, memory management, and persistence strategies, ensuring reproducibility and extensibility for future research.

***

## 1. Agent Architecture  

### 1.1. Pattern Recognition Agent  
- Computes vector embeddings for incoming log entries and performs similarity search against historical patterns to retrieve relevant parsing examples[1][2][3].  
- Handles cold-start via bootstrap examples: rule-based templates or self-generated examples using LLM self-talk techniques[4][5].  

### 1.2. Data Extraction Agent  
- Applies specialized parsers:  
  - **Regex-Based Parser** for simple key-value pairs.  
  - **Semantic Parser** using LLMs to handle nested or free-form log structures[6][7].  
- Selects parsing strategy dynamically via a parsing coordinator.

### 1.3. Timeline Construction Agent  
- Orders extracted events chronologically and infers causal/temporal relationships using EventBERT-like models and graph construction techniques[8][9][10].  

### 1.4. Anomaly Detection Agent  
- Uses top-k similar historical task logs as baselines to detect statistical deviations and pattern disruptions[11][12].  
- Aggregates multi-dimensional metrics (frequency, timing, sequence) to flag anomalies[13][14].  

### 1.5. Relevance Assessment Agent  
- Assesses which events are significant via unsupervised anomaly detection, temporal clustering, and cross-event correlation[15][12].  
- Applies dynamic thresholds based on task similarity scores and historical success/failure statistics[14][16].

## 2. Dynamic Log Parsing and Prompting  

### 2.1. Dynamic Prompt Generation  
- **Structure Detection**: Classifies logs (e.g., simple_delimited, nested_key_value) via lightweight parsers.  
- **Few-Shot Example Selection**: Retrieves relevant parsing examples from memory to include in prompts[17][18][19].  
- **Self-Generated In-Context Learning (SG-ICL)**: Generates synthetic examples when none exist[20].  

### 2.2. Handling Novel Formats  
- **Fallback Strategies**: Decompose log into components, apply rule-based extraction, or invoke human-in-the-loop for high-novelty cases[21][22].  
- **Adaptive Templates**: Prompts adapt based on retrieved example structures, not fixed formats.

***

## 3. Memory System and Continuous Learning  

### 3.1. Multi-Tiered Memory Model  
- **Interaction Memory**: Stores individual parsing successes and failures.  
- **Semantic Memory**: Abstracts patterns into general parsing strategies and rules[23][24].  
- **Procedural Memory**: Records parsing workflows and prompts that yielded high-confidence results.

### 3.2. Learning Storage and Retrieval  
- **Vector Store**: Persists embeddings of log patterns and examples for semantic similarity search[1][2].  
- **Key-Value Store**: Records structured parsing results and metadata (strategy used, confidence score).  
- **Bootstrap Memory**: Initial rule-based templates for cold start scenarios.

### 3.3. Memory Sharing and Evolution  
- Agents share memory via a common repository (e.g., MongoDB with LangGraph or MIRIX framework)[25][26].  
- Periodic abstraction generates new high-level parsing rules from accumulated examples.

***

## 4. Persistence and Fault Tolerance  

### 4.1. Persistent Storage Technologies  
- **MongoDB Atlas + LangGraph**: ACID-compliant, vector search, TTL indexes for stale data[25][27].  
- **MIRIX**: Specialized multi-agent memory system with six memory types and built-in persistence[26].  
- **SAMEP Protocol**: Secure, distributed memory exchange for agent collaboration[28].

### 4.2. Recovery and Checkpointing  
- **Checkpoint Frequency**: Snapshot memory state every N operations.  
- **Transaction Logging**: Record all parsing outcomes to replay after failure[29][30].  
- **Startup Recovery Protocol**:  
  1. Load last checkpoint.  
  2. Replay transactions since checkpoint.  
  3. Rebuild vector indexes.  
  4. Validate memory consistency and resume operations.

***

## 5. Database Schema Normalization  

### 5.1. Schema Components  
- **Tasks Table**: `task_id`, `task_type`, `start_time`, metadata.  
- **Events Table**:  
  - `event_id`, `task_id` (FK), `timestamp`, `event_type`.  
  - `parent_event_id` for causal links.  
  - `system_state` JSON capturing CPU, memory, etc.  
  - `is_anomaly` flag and `anomaly_type`[31].  

### 5.2. Relationship and Context Capture  
- **Event Relationships**: Causal chains via `parent_event_id`.  
- **Task Context**: Foreign key linking events to tasks.  
- **System State**: Snapshot of environment metrics.  
- **Anomaly Markers**: Boolean flags and categorical labels.

***

## 6. Usage Workflow  

1. **Initialization**: Bootstrap memory with rule-based templates.  
2. **Log Ingestion**: New log entries routed by Parsing Coordinator.  
3. **Pattern Matching**: Retrieve similar examples or bootstrap if cold start.  
4. **Dynamic Prompting**: Generate and execute LLM prompts for structured extraction.  
5. **Timeline Assembly**: Order and link events chronologically.  
6. **Anomaly Detection**: Compare against historical baselines to identify deviations.  
7. **Memory Update**: Store parsing results, update embeddings, adjust schemas.  
8. **Persistence**: Checkpoint memory and log transactions for recovery.
